HMS 1 implements the clustering of medical students based on 24 variables. The students are categorized into 3 subgroups: flourishing, getting by and at-risk.  
HMS 2 plots the mean values of three subgroups for all 24 variables.  
HMS 3 plots the gender percentage for each cluster.
Specifically, we apply HMS 2016-2021combined_file_MDonly.csv to build the clutsering model, then we use HMS 2016-2021combined_file_PHDonly.csv to construct another clustering model. The clustering results of these two align well, which verifies the soundness and generality of our clustering model.
